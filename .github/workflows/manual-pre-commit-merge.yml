# GitHub Actions Workflow: Auto-approve and merge pre-commit version updates
# Purpose: This workflow automatically approves and merges pull requests created by the
# pre-commit-ci bot when they only modify the .pre-commit-config.yaml file. This is useful
# for keeping pre-commit hooks up to date without manual intervention while ensuring safety
# by only auto-merging changes to the pre-commit configuration file.

name: Fred's Test pre-commit version updates

# Trigger conditions: This workflow runs when pull requests are opened, updated (synchronize),
# or reopened. It does NOT run on draft PRs being marked as ready or on PR edits.
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# Allow manual running of workflow
  workflow_dispatch:

# Define permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN used in this workflow
# These follow the principle of least privilege - only granting what's necessary
permissions:
  contents: write # Required to merge the PR into the base branch
  pull-requests: write # Required to approve the PR and add comments
  checks: read # Required to check the status of CI/CD checks before merging

jobs:
  # Main job that handles the entire auto-approval and merge process
  auto-approve-merge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner (GitHub-hosted)

    steps:
      # Step 1: Verify that the PR was created by the pre-commit-ci bot
      # This is a security measure to ensure we only auto-merge bot PRs
      # Identifier used to reference this step's outputs in later steps
      # Compare the actor (PR creator) with the expected bot username
      # Set output variable to true if it's the pre-commit bot
      # Set output variable to false for any other user/bot
